This repository contains the implementation of Deep Q learning using a custom pong game, along with saliency map visualization using integrated gradients. The project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning techniques to develop an AI that can effectively play pong against a human player and a simple ball-tracking algorithm.

## Project Overview

The pong game is implemented in Python using the `pygame` library. The AI agent is trained using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach, with the environment specially crafted to allow for interactive gameplay. Saliency maps generated through integrated gradients provide insights into what the AI focuses on while making decisions.
